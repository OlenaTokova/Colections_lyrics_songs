The project is designed to create a comprehensive tool that enables users to search for lyrics and YouTube links for specific songs using Google search and then scraping the content from the relevant pages. This is particularly useful for retrieve lyrics and related video content efficiently.
# Main Goal
The main goal is to automate the retrieval of song lyrics and YouTube video links for specific songs using a combination of Google search and web scraping techniques. This provides a streamlined process for users to access multimedia resources associated with their favorite songs or research needs.

# How It Works
 - User Input: The program starts with a user entering the singer's name and song title into a Streamlit web interface.
 - Google Search Query Formation: It constructs a Google search URL to find lyrics on "lyrics.lyricfind.com" and another to search for song videos on YouTube.
 - HTTP Requests: The script sends an HTTP request to fetch the Google search results page.
 - HTML Parsing: Using BeautifulSoup, the script parses the HTML of the search results to find relevant links to lyrics and YouTube videos.
 - Selenium for Web Scraping: If the standard HTTP request and parsing aren't sufficient, Selenium, a browser automation tool, is employed to interact with web pages dynamically to extract content like lyrics text and YouTube links.
 - Display Results: The extracted lyrics and video links are displayed to the user through the Streamlit interface.
# Data Processing
 - Text Data Handling: The program processes text data obtained from HTML content of web pages, extracting and cleaning to present useful information.
 - URL Manipulation: Parsing and constructing URLs accurately to facilitate precise search results.
# Methods Used
- Web Scraping: BeautifulSoup for static content and Selenium for dynamic content that requires interaction with JavaScript elements on the page.
 - Regular Expressions: To extract and clean URLs and other text data effectively.
 - Automated Browser Interaction: Selenium simulates a user browsing to handle JavaScript-rendered website content.
# Visualization and Image Processing
 - Streamlit: Used for building a user-friendly web interface where results are displayed. It provides interactive elements like text inputs and buttons.
# Potential Future Uses and Utility
- Integration into Music Apps: This tool could be integrated into music applications to provide lyrics and video links alongside streaming services.
 - Research and Education: Useful in academic settings where students or researchers analyze song lyrics or study music videos.
 - Content Creation: Bloggers and video creators can use this tool to quickly find lyrics and reference videos for their content.
# Main Conclusions
The project effectively automates the task of finding and displaying song lyrics and associated YouTube videos, providing a valuable resource for various user groups interested in music.
